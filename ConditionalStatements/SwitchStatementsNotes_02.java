        Switch case:
        ans:
        The java switch case statements executes one statements from an multiple conditions.
        Similar to if else if ladder.
        [
        NOTES:- 
        Switch case in java test the equality of a variables against multiple values.
        ]
        The switch statements works with byte, int, long, short, char and etc.
        POINTS TO REMEMBER:
        -> There can be more than one or N number of cases.
        -> The case value must be switch expression type, must be literals or constant.
        notes: Switch case does not allows a variables
        -> Each switch case statements have break statements which is optional in java.
        -> There might be default case in java after all the cases is tested.
        -> In java, Switch statements is fall through, which means if there is no any 
        break statements then it runs all the cases.
        sytanx:
        switch(expression){
            case 1:
                break; //Optional
            case 2:
                break; //Optional
            case 3:
                break; //Optional
            case 4:
                break; //Optional
            ............


            default:
            //code to be executed if all cases are not found.
        }
