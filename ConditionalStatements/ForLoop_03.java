        For Loop:
        ans:
        In prorgamming languages, loop are the sets of instruction or function that 
        gets executes one after another until or unless the condition becomes false.

        what is an For Loop?
        ans: The java for loop is a control flow statements that iterates a part of 
        the program multiple times.
        when to use: if the number of iteration is fixed then at that condition, for
        loop is recommanded to use.
        syntax:
        for(intit;condition;increment/decrement){
            //code to be executed.
        }
        
        ********
        For Each loop in java
        ********
        ans: 
        The for-each loop in java is used to traverse array or collection in java.
        -> Easier to use as compare to simple for loop because we donot have to
        increment value and use subscript notation.
        -> It works on elements basis not index.
        -> Return elements one by one in the defined variables.
        syntax:
        for(DataType a: array){
            //code to be executed.
        }


        **********************
        Java infinite for loop
        **********************
        ans:if you use two semicolons ;; in the for loop, it will be indefinite for 
        loop.
        syntax:
        for(;;){
            //code to be executed
        }

        what is while loop?
        ans: The java while loop is a control flow statements that gets executes 
        repeatedly according to the given boolean condition.
        when to use: if the number of iteration is not fixed then at that condition,
        while loop is recommanded to use.
        syntax:
        while(condition){
            increment/decrement
            //code to be executed
        }

        what is do while loop?
        ans: The java do while loop is also a control flow statements that gets the
        certain part of the programs at least once and further execution depends on
        the given boolean condition.
        when to use: if the number of the iteration is not fixed but you must have to
        execute a program at least once.
        do{
            //code to be executed
            increment/decrement

        }while(condition)
