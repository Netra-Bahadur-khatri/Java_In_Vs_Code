        The java if statements test the condtion either given condition is true or false.As we know that condition 
        is always checks boolean i.e. true or false
        Various types statements in java:


        -> if statements:
        ans: 
        syntax:
        if(condition){
            //statements or code be executed
        }


        -> if-else statements:
        ans:
        syntax:
        if(condition){
            //statement1
            //execute if the condition is true other wise goes to else part
            // to execute statement2
        }else{
            //statement2
            //execute if the given condition is false.
        }


        -> if-else-if ladder:
        ans: the java if else if ladder statements executes one condition from multiple statements
        syntax:
        if(condition1){
            //code to be executed if the condition1 is true.
        }else if(condition2){
            //code to be executed if the condition2 is true.
        }else if(condition3){
            //code to be executed if the condition3 is true.
        }else{
            //code to be executed if all the given condition is false.
        }


        -> nested if statements:
        ans: The java nested if block represents that if block within another if block.
        Note: Here, inner block condition get executed only if the Outer block condition is true.
        syntax:
        if(condition1){
            //condition2 gets executed if condition1 becomes true.
            if(condition2){
                //condition3 gets executed if condition2 becomes true.
                if(condition3)
                and so on.
            }
        }
