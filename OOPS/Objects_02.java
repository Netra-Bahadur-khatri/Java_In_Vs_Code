        Objects in java can be physical(tangible) and logical(intangible) entity
        But
        Class in java is always a logical entity.

        Objects contains an state and behaviours.

        Ques no. 1 What is an tangible ?

            4. Blocks.
            5. Nested class and Interfaces.
