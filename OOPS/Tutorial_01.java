        /*
        just for remember :-
        Simula is the first object oriented programming languages in the world.
        Concepts of OOPS in java programming languages:


        1.Objects
        --> An Entity that has state and behavior.
        Notes: An object and an Entity is similar because both has the properties and characteristics to describe them particularly.
        eg: Dog--> has walking, sleeping, eating,barking and so on properties.
        --> eg: chair, pen, bike, mouse, keyboard, etc.
        --> Also knowns as an instance of class.
        Notes:
        When we declared an class, this does not occupy an space in memory section but if we create an objects of certain class this will occupy an certain amount of space in any section of memory.


        2.Class
        --> Collection of objects.
        --> logical entity.
        --> Also a blueprint for an objects.
        --> Declaring an class doesnot occupy an space in memory.


        3.Inheritance
        --> When one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of a parent object, then we can called it as Inheritance.
        --> Provides an resuability of code.
        --> Mainly used to achive an runtime polymorphism.


        4.Polymorphism
        --> more than one forms is called polymorphism.
        --> performing an one tasks in differents ways is called polymorphism.
        -->eg:- father at home, husband for wife and employee at office.
        -->eg:- to convince the customer: Drawring --> triangle, square, rectangle, circle, ellipse and so on.

        
        5.Abstraction
        6.Encapsulation
